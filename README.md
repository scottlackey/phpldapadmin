phpldapadmin
============

customized templates for phpldapadmin

Let's face it, no one uses csh or tcsh anymore, so why are they the only options for shells in the phpldapadmin templates?
Because they are out of date. I've modified a lot of settings and included the sudoers template because basically everyone 
is using this in a modern environment and not on their Irix servers in their huge NASA datacenter. Anyway, hope you find them useful.
